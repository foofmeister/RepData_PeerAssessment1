## Loading and preprocessing the data

```{r}
setwd("C:/Users/summers.forest/R/Coursera/4. Reproducible Research")
activity <- read.csv(file = "activity.csv",sep=",",stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
activity.complete <- activity[complete.cases(activity),]
```

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?

```{r}
activity.complete$date <- as.factor(activity.complete$date)
sum <- sapply(split(activity.complete$steps, activity.complete$date), sum)
hist(sum, main = "Total Number of Steps Taken Per Day")
median(sum)
mean(sum)
```

## What is the average daily activity pattern?



## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
